The difference between doing any task in a conventional way and doing it professionally is vast, regardless of how small the task may be.

If I ask you to design a login form, how much time would it take? You will only design it using HTML, CSS. There will be only an email and password field, and a submit button.
Will it take ten minutes, twenty minutes, or a maximum of one hour?

Now, let me add some professional requirements to my request.
游릭 It must be coded using the semantic syntax of HTML5.
游릭 The design should be responsive for five breakpoints.
游릭 It should support all browsers in the market.
游릭 It should be readable on screen readers.
游릭 Navigation should be possible using the keyboard.
游릭 If someone wants to change properties like color, border, radius, margin, padding, etc., they should be able to do so by changing variable values without touching the design code.
游릭 Follow proper naming conventions. You may use the BEM method.
游릭 The code should be maintainable and adaptable, allowing other developers to easily add variants.
游릭 Follow the single responsibility principle, where each class performs a specific task.
游릭 The code should be readable, with necessary comments wherever needed.
游릭 Prepare necessary documentation.
游릭 Conduct regression testing.
游릭 Commit after each logical change, following conventional commit messages, and maintain a change log.

Now, tell me, how much time do you think it would take to create this login form?
