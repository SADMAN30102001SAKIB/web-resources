1. Data flows from parent to children. So, if we need to share data between two or more components, then we need to create the state in their common parent component & pass data downwards to those specific children. ex:
App => state Data
    - Header => Favorites Count
    - Body
        - Movie Container => Movie cards w/ "add btn"
    - Footer
2. Mainly 2 types of stylings are used in industries:
   i) CSS Modules to Separate the stylings of each component. Bundler takes all the modular css files & wrap them in a single css file and link it inside html. The class names get changed because of the bundler to avoid collision.
    ex:
    - create a main.modules.css file where you can write CSS styles normally.
    - import it in the jsx file where you what to use it.
    (ex: import style form './Body.module.css')
    - then use it like this, className={`${style.btn} ${style.container}`}
   ii) UI Libraries
